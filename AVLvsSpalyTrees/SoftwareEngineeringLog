	Started project 1, following the instructions that were given in the handout.
	Let's make sure that both trees are working properly with the soccer teams.
	Now that the trees seem to be working, I will build a method that will be able to count the number of nodes accessed. 
	Also, I already made the main, I just need to test and comment.

	Still needs testing, I just worked in the comments.

	All tests done, I had some little bugs with the Splay tree, for some reason I had some nodes being removed during some lookups. I deleted the remove method since they were not necessarely needed, and now everything is working perfectly.
